## Disclaimer
- This was a prototype so...
    - Many features are not done
    - Website is a bit slow
    - CSS is very basic
    - and there might be some bugs.
- Was built on my free time from NS so wasn't full-time on the project

## Project Background
    - Was a request from my father on how to improve his company's event registration process
    - Previously, they used Excel sheets and EventBrite
    - **Problem:** Took a long time to check in users, creating a long line during events
    - Wasn't employed, given any money or signed any contract. Feedback was mostly from my father and not staff from the company.
    - Project was dropped in the end because the company's higher-ups wasn't comfortable with a third party handling the database, needing lots of approval

## Overview on user workflow
1. Staff creates a new event
2. Staff sends register event link to users
3. Users register event through link
4. Users receive email with QR Code
5. Users attend event
6. Staff quickly scans QR Code, authenticate and checks in users

- After submitting the form, the user should get a QR Code with the event information. (Planned to send a reminder email a few days before the event but didn't do it since project was dropped)
