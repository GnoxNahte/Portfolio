## Why I chose to build a website from scratch
- Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript / TypeScript
- More flexibility and control
- Search functionality, making it easier for potential clients / employers to find projects related to the work they are doing
- Better performance (Compared to website builders)
- My [previous website](https://ethanong-jh.wixsite.com/portfolio) for reference (Using Wix)

## Why I chose [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- Easy to start, for a beginner in web development
- Has great markdown features, making it easy to create new project pages and update the site. Like a blog
- Fast and responsive with its islands architecture 
- Free
- Open source 
- Active community 
- Frequent updates

## Things to improve
- UI Design
    - I'm mainly a programmer with very less knowledge on website UI design.
    - Please give feedback on how to improve the website. It would be much appreciated.
